<hr>

The main idea is to integrate various services, such as luggage location and flight status, into one place, making the traveler's life easier with information that is not usually easily accessible.

Information about luggage updates, boarding gate, boarding time, best nearby places to eat, where to withdraw money, among other options, are part of our roadmap, to ultimately add value to the end user.

## Goal

To make the journey from the airport to the final destination easy and uncomplicated.
